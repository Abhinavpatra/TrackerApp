## Data Storage

The app uses **AsyncStorage** for local data persistence:
- Period cycles and settings stored as JSON in device storage
- Survives app restarts and device reboots
- No internet connection required
- Data is completely private to your device
- Automatic cycle length and period duration calculations

### Storage Location
- **Android**: Internal app storage (not accessible to other apps)
- **iOS**: App sandbox (not accessible to other apps)

## Notifications

The app includes local notifications to remind you:
- **Period Reminders**: Get notified 1-2 days before your expected period
- **Customizable**: Adjust notification timing in settings
- **Offline**: Notifications work without internet connection
- **Privacy**: All notification scheduling is done locally

## Customization

### Adding New Features
1. Edit `App.tsx` to add new functionality
2. Update the `PeriodCycle` and `CycleSettings` interfaces if needed
3. Modify the calendar and UI components in the `render` function

### Changing Storage Method
Replace AsyncStorage with SQLite for more complex data:
```bash
npm install expo-sqlite
```

### Styling
All styles are in the `StyleSheet.create()` section at the bottom of `App.tsx`.
The app uses a greenish-white color scheme with these main colors:
- Background: `#f0f8f0` (light greenish-white)
- Primary: `#4a7c59` (forest green)
- Secondary: `#2d5a2d` (dark green)
- Accent: `#6b8e6b` (medium green)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Metro bundler not found"**
```bash
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli
```

**"Android SDK not found"**
- Make sure Android Studio is installed
- Check ANDROID_HOME environment variable
- Run `npx react-native doctor` to diagnose issues

**"Build failed"**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run android
```

**"App crashes on startup"**
- Check Metro bundler is running (`npm start`)
- Clear Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`

### Getting Help
- Check the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- Look at [AsyncStorage docs](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/)
- Search for React Native issues on Stack Overflow
